# Crypto.py 
To Run the script: - python3 crypto.py

Definition Functions:
fetch_book_data -  I used this definition to validate if the endpoints are valid and getting the response back and if we are getting metadata - capture it.
extract_data - This function is the main logic, it extracts the data we got from fetch_book_data and loops through all the cells in the metadata by incrementing the logic of  "$100k of bid and ask order book data for each exchange"
append_data - Function to append data to a json file.
